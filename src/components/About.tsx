          <p className="text-xl text-slate-600 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            I'm a passionate developer with a love for creating digital solutions that combine 
            technical excellence with beautiful design.

              With over 5 years of experience in web development, I specialize in creating 
              full-stack applications that are both powerful and user-friendly. My journey 
              started with a curiosity about how things work, and has evolved into a career 
              focused on building meaningful digital experiences.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              I believe that great software isn't just about code â€“ it's about understanding 
              user needs, solving real problems, and crafting solutions that make people's 
              lives easier and more enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to 
              open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community through 
              blogs and mentorship.
